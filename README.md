# ML Demand Model Projects

## Overview  
This repository contains various econometric, machine learning, and deep learning models for demand estimation. The project utilizes the **IRI Academic Dataset**, shared via **Google Drive**, for analysis.

## Team Members  
- **Minha Hwang**  
- **Sang Su (Paul) Lee**  
- **Jinhyuk Lee**  
- **Seonah Lee**  

## Language  
- **Python**  

## Models Implemented  

### Econometric Models  
1. **Homogeneous Logit**  
2. **BLP (Berry-Levinsohn-Pakes)**: Assumes an independent normal distribution for product attributes, price, feature, and display.  
3. **Log-Log Model (Hierarchical Bayes - SCAN PRO Plus)**: The most widely used approach.  
4. **Log-Log Model (OLS)**  

### Machine Learning Models  
5. **Random Forest**  
6. **XGBoost**  
7. **Decision Tree**  
8. **Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)**  

### Deep Learning Models  
9. **TimeGPT**  
10. **Other Potential Candidates** (TBD)  

### Deprioritized Models  
11. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** (?)  
12. **Boosting** (?)  
13. **Stacking** (?)  
14. **AutoML**  

## Notes  
- The models are benchmarked to evaluate their effectiveness in demand forecasting.  
- Additional models may be considered as the project progresses.
